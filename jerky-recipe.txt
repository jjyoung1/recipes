Introduction

This is a delicious homemade jerky recipe we developed because we were tired of expensive store-bought jerky which contained lots of sugar and not nearly enough flavor.

I set the # of servings to 100 to make it easy to convert to however many slices you make.

Enjoy but be careful . . . it is highly addictive and you may find yourself eating it all at once!

Minutes to Prepare: 10
Number of Servings: 100

Ingredients

3½	lbs	flank steak or London broil
1¼	tsp	black pepper
1¼	tsp	chili powder
1	tsp	cayenne
1¼	tsp	garlic powder
1¼	tsp	onion powder
1	tsp	liquid smoke
2½	tsp	salt
¼	c	Tamari
¾	c	Worcestershire sauce
½	c	water

Tips

TIPS: 

► To make cutting easier, put the meat in a single layer in the freezer for 30-45 minutes before cutting. It should be semi-stiff but not all-the-way frozen.

► For longer, chewier jerky, cut WITH the grain of the meat.

► For shorter, more tender jerky, cut ACROSS the grain.

► While marinating, it helps to turn and "massage" the meat every several hours to make sure the marinade flavors all parts of all the strips evenly.

► The recipe as is is good for most folks, but I like mine with extra kick: I add another 1 tbsp black pepper and 1 tbsp cayenne after marinating but before drying.

► Make sure you use Tamari instead of regular soy sauce. Normal soy sauce has wheat added to it, adding unnecessary carbs to the recipe.


Directions

0. Remove all the fat and any membranes from the flank steak.
1. Cut steak into ¼ to ½ inch-wide strips.
2. Mix all other ingredients in a bowl.
3. Put meat into one or more large Ziploc bags.
4. Add marinade (split evenly among bags).
5. Let rest in the refrigerator for 6-24 hours.
6. Dry your jerky.

**Method 1**

Buy a food dehydrator and follow the instructions that come with it. This is the best and easiest method.

**Method 2**

(1) Place your meat on as many cookie sheets as it takes to lay it all out in a single layer.
(2) Place it in a 150° oven for between 4-6 hours. Check it every 30 minutes after 4 hours until it reaches your desired texture.

**Method 3**

Follow Alton Brown's method using a box fan and AC filters. Read about it here: http://bit.ly/altons_jerky

Serving Size: Makes 50-100 pieces (the way I do it)
